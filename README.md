# clean-architechture-book-management
## Overview

Welcome to MyProject Web API, a robust and scalable web application built using .NET Core and organized following Clean Architecture principles. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, facilitating maintainability, testability, and scalability of the application.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several layers, each responsible for different aspects of the application:

- **Core Layer**: Contains the core business logic and domain entities.
- **Application Layer**: Contains the application-specific logic, including services and mappers.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Handles data access, repositories, and configuration settings.
- **Presentation Layer**: Manages the web API controllers, middleware, and routing logic.
